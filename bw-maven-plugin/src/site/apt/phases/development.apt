Development

===

	In any project it is very important to synchronise all developers with the
	latest version of code. It implies to have up-to-date dependencies
	(Projlibs, JARs...) and a unified configuration of the development tool
	(i.e. TIBCO Designer).
	
	With BWMaven plugin, this setup of development part is managed with the same
	logic of packaging phase.
	
	It means that the same preliminary steps will be executed before launching
	TIBCO Designer to open a project.
